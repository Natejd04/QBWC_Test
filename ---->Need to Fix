Things that need to be completed. 
X	1) Tracking worker, will break if 1 result or fewer. (fixed)
X	2) Need to add RegEx for tracking to eliminate accidents. (fixed)
X	3) Only pull Today's invoices. (fixed)
	4) Should there be a way to delete shipments?
	5) Add a way to check if you want to send the email.
	6) Make the Send Tracking Today button work.
	7) Create Email template (one template for all, memo field only on UPP)
	8) Currently importing line items, do we want this? (maybe for next step)
	9) Emails will not send if a customer is missing a name, email, tracking# or method.
